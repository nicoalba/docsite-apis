## Running locally

### Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, make sure you've installed:

1. **Python 3**: You need Python 3 to run MkDocs. Download and install Python 3 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **MkDocs**: Install MkDocs using pip (Python's package manager):
    
    ```bash
    pip install mkdocs
    ```

## Steps to run locally

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder and cd into the project directory where the `mkdocs.yml` file is located:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```

3. Install dependencies (if necessary).

    If you're using additional extensions or themes for MkDocs, make sure they're installed:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can skip this step.

    ```
